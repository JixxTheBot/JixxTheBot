 Hey there! 👋

I'm **ms prince**, a programmer from Kerala.  
I build things that I imagine — especially for **SA-MP**, **open.mp**, and custom game launchers.

If an idea hits me, I’ll prototype it, build it, and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **C#**, **C++**, **Pawn**, **Lua**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.  
Recently, I've been working on SA-MP systems such as **stock markets**, **custom HUDs**, **vehicle mechanics**, and **launchers with auto-update systems**.

I love making tools that make servers or gameplay feel unique.

I've built tons of personal and private scripts for SA-MP — from checkpoint systems to admin tools to advanced UI systems — and I continue experimenting with new concepts every day.

If you want to learn how I build or want help with SA-MP scripts, feel free to reach out!
