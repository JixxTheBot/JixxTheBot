<h2> Hey there! 👋</h2>

I'm [Jixx](#), a programmer from India.  
I build things that I imagine — especially for **SA-MP**, **open.mp**, and custom game launchers.

If an idea hits me, I’ll prototype it, build it, and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **C#**, **C++**, **Pawn**, **Lua**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.  
Currently, I’m developing my own game from scratch

I love making tools that make servers or gameplay feel unique.

I've built tons of personal and private scripts for SA-MP — from checkpoint systems to admin tools to advanced UI systems — and I continue experimenting with new concepts every day.

If you want to learn how I build or want help with SA-MP scripts, feel free to reach out!
